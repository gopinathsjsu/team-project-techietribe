# XP Core Values

## Simplicity:
This core value was held by Bhavya. I was responsible to make sure that everyone in our team stays on track and also in creating the user interface for our web application. Since GUI is responsible for the implementation of all APIs, ensuring accountability for each API helped us preserve the application's reliability and integrity. I've also taken care of keeping track of the requirements for each API.

## Communication:
This core value is held by Pranjali. I was responsible for overseeing the operations that take place over the course of our project. This core principle ensured that all of the project's deliverables were met at each point. Overall, by adhering to the Communication value, we are mindful of how much unfinished work is in progress and have prioritized it to ensure that it is done as a team.

## Feedback:
This core value is held by Manjiri. We minimized the time it took for each item that is dependent on another item to pass through the system and we were in charge of maintaining the continuous feedback loop, which was critical for continuous improvement. We also eliminated issues created by task switching and decreased the need to reprioritize items on a regular basis.


## Courage: 
This core value was held by Supriya. Held accountable for taking courage to speak the truth and be more realistic. Not every problem can be solved in the manner that it is posed to us, and we must evaluate each opportunity realistically. As a result, I made sure that our whole team could see the learning and adaptation of each API, ensuring that the work progress was a continuous integration for developing our final product.
